#Interactive Quiz Application â€“ Task Description
Introduction
The Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based project designed to provide a seamless and dynamic quiz experience. This task was part of the internship at CODTECH IT Solutions, under the Front-End Development domain, with Neela Santosh as the mentor. The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional quiz application with a modern, user-friendly interface, dynamic question loading, and score tracking capabilities. The project was built using core front-end web technologies and was structured with best practices to ensure clean, maintainable, and responsive code.

Tools and Technologies Used
Languages and Frameworks:
HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the web page, including the quiz container, questions, and options.
CSS3: Applied to style the quiz interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. Custom CSS was used for styling the buttons, hover effects, and color schemes for selected and correct/incorrect answers.
JavaScript (ES6): Used to add interactivity and functionality to the application. JavaScript handles the dynamic loading of questions, checks the answers, keeps track of the score, and controls the flow of the quiz.

Development Environment:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): The entire project was developed in VS Code, a popular code editor with extensive extensions and debugging capabilities. The Live Server extension was used to instantly preview changes and test the application in real-time.
Git and GitHub: The project was version-controlled using Git and uploaded to a GitHub repository. This allowed for easy code management, sharing, and collaboration.

Project Functionality
The Interactive Quiz Application features:
Dynamic Question Loading: The quiz dynamically displays multiple-choice questions with answer options. It uses a JavaScript array of objects to store the questions, options, and correct answers.

Answer Validation: When a user selects an option, it validates whether the answer is correct or incorrect by highlighting the selected option in green (for correct) or red (for incorrect).

Score Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz. Each correct answer increments the score by 1.

Next Question Navigation: After selecting an answer, the user can click the Next button to proceed to the following question. The quiz continues until all questions are answered.

Final Score Display: At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their final score along with the total number of questions answered correctly.

Responsive UI: The design ensures that the quiz layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Platforms and Deployment
The project was developed and tested locally using the Live Server extension in VS Code.
The final version was pushed to GitHub, making it accessible and easy to share. This also allows for future collaboration, updates, and improvements.

 Applications of the Interactive Quiz Application
The Interactive Quiz Application has several real-world applications, including:
E-learning Platforms: This application can be easily integrated into online learning management systems (LMS). It can be used to create quizzes for educational courses, helping teachers assess student knowledge interactively.
